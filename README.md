# ⚡ Electro Dash

Electro Dash is a **Next.js + Firebase powered schedule dashboard** built to manage weekly class routines, upcoming CTs, reschedules, skips, and notes — all in one place.

No more asking _"CT kobe?"_ — this app tells you.

Clean UI, notifications coming soon, and designed specifically around the Saturday–Wednesday academic week cycle.
